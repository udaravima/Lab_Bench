# Session Handover — Lab_Bench modular PSU

Written 2026-07-16 for the next agent (or future session) continuing this
project. Read this + README.md before touching anything.

## The user & working agreement

- Hobbyist building a **multi-channel modular bench PSU**, learning along the
  way — explain the *why* of engineering decisions, not just the what.
- **Git: standing permission to commit; NEVER `git push`** — the user pushes.
- Cost-sensitive: verify prices before recommending purchases; user buys from
  Mouser normally, LCSC acceptable.
- "Confirm everything without hallucinating": every part number, pinout,
  rating and register claim gets verified against a local datasheet, the
  vendor's own PDF (web fetch OK), or measured behaviour. This discipline has
  caught real bugs every single session — including my own wrong Isat claim.

## What the project is

Up to 8 hot-pluggable 600 W buck modules on a 24–30 V bus, each an analog
CV/CC supply (diode-OR'd error amps injecting into an LM5145/LM5143 FB node —
firmware is never in the regulation loop), STM32G431 per module, ESP32-S3
manager, CAN 2.0B @500k. Docs 01–07 are the spec; read 05 (build plan) first
— it has phase exit criteria. Phase 1 = single 150 W LM5145 prototype.

## State at handover (git log tells the story; never rebase published history)

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| Design docs 01–07 | complete (07 = module firmware, new) |
| Phase-1 schematic | **complete, v1**: 7 generated sheets, 137 components, ~90 nets machine-verified; audited (kicad-happy + ngspice 38/40 pass) |
| Footprints | all vetted; custom lib `labbench.pretty` (LM5145 RGY, LMR36015 RNX, DAC80502 no-EP WSON, PowerFET_SON5x6_GDS) |
| PCB | **DEFERRED by user decision (2026-07-16): all phases' boards get laid out together at the end.** Committed board = clean pass-1 (placement + pours + planes + critical routes, 0 copper DRC); `autoroute.py` is WIP (33 unconnected, notes in its header) |
| Module firmware | v0.1 builds clean (6.3 KB): full peripheral binding + CAN dispatch around the host-tested `module_core`. Untested on silicon (no board yet) |
| Host tests | `cd firmware/tests && make test` — must stay green |
| Manager firmware | not started |
| Phase-2 circuit design | **complete (docs/08, 2026-07-16)**: all values worked + datasheet-verified; LM5143/LM5069/CSD18540Q5B/CSD19536KTT/XAL1510/TMUX1101/TL431 PDFs now in docs/datasheets/ |
| Phase-2 schematic | **complete, v1, audited (2026-07-17)**: 8 sheets, 171 components, 116 nets machine-verified; kicad-happy audit triaged (all errors = known false-positive classes or the deferred MPN pass — same baseline as Phase-1); ngspice **45/47 pass** (crystal warn + bridge skip = same model limitations as Phase-1's 38/40) |
| Phase-3 schematics | **complete, v1, audited (2026-07-17)**: backplane (29 comps, EXACT net assertions) + manager (80 comps) — audit caught a real omission (manager I²C pull-ups specified in docs/09 but not drawn; fixed, PR-001 clear). SPICE: manager 16/16, backplane 3/3. Backplane "missing I²C pull-up" findings = by design (manager owns them) |
| Manager firmware | **core v0.1 host-tested (2026-07-18)**: manager_core (discovery, #15 supervision, docs/03 §3 ack/retry, #17 budget arbiter, §7 charge sequencer) green in firmware/tests; ESP-IDF shell committed as an UNBUILT skeleton (no IDF toolchain here — UI/SCPI are TODO stubs) |
| Ordering/BOM | **China-first sourcing pass done (hardware/SOURCING.md, 2026-07-18)**: LCSC prices/stock verified for all phases (~$135 parts for the Phase-3 build, ~$300–380 all-in); inductor + slot-connector decisions taken (Sunlord + 3.75 mΩ shunts APPLIED to gen_phase2; XT60PW slots queued); order-early list: LTC7004 (5 pcs), CSD19536KTT (12 pcs). MPN-properties pass into symbols still pending |

## Immediate next steps (agreed order)

1. **Manager firmware** (docs/10 architecture doc first): discovery, UI,
   SCPI-over-USB, budget arbiter, charge sequencer — reuses
   firmware/common/labbench_can.h verbatim; ESP-IDF, TWAI @500k.
   GPIO map is in docs/09 §3 (matches the generated schematic exactly).
   Phase-2 audit notes (2026-07-17): VM-001 on CAN_*/DROOP_EN/PS_FPWM/
   PS_PGOOD/I_MEAS/V_MEAS all false positives (VIO-variant / verified
   V_IH / R31-mitigated / divider-bounded); FS-001 "FB divider too low-Z"
   is the injection scheme working as designed; RS-001 set identical to
   the audited Phase-1 baseline.
2. **Phase-3 backplane + ESP32-S3 manager schematics** (bus bars, slot IDs,
   CAN termination, E-stop; manager board with display/encoder/USB).
3. **ESP32-S3 manager firmware** (discovery, UI, SCPI, budget arbiter,
   charge sequencer) — reuses `firmware/common/labbench_can.h` verbatim.
4. Then the batch PCB pass: finish `autoroute.py` (fix list in its header),
   silk cleanup, PGND-island recheck (audit PS-002 expects resolution after
   routing), gerbers + gerber analyzer, MPN pass → BOM CSVs → order files.

## Verification workflow (non-negotiable, it works)

- Schematic change → `gen_phase1.py` → export netlist → `check_netlist.py` +
  `check_footprints.py`, all green, EXPECTED_NETS updated in the same commit.
- Board change → `gen_board.py` (pour/courtyard/edge assertions) →
  `route_board.py` → `run_drc.py`.
- Pipeline details + hard-won pcbnew API traps:
  `hardware/phase1-module/tools/README.md`.
- Audit stack available and installed: kicad-happy plugin skills (kicad, emc,
  spice, bom, distributor search) + **ngspice** installed; ARM toolchain at
  `~/tools/xpack-arm-none-eabi-gcc-14.2.1-1.1` (Makefile auto-finds it).
- Datasheets live in `docs/datasheets/` (gitignored). Vendor ECAD ZIPs in
  `hardware/phase1-module/lib/vendor/` (gitignored). If a needed datasheet is
  missing, ask the user (they download from Mouser) or fetch the vendor PDF.

## Load-bearing design decisions (with the trap each one avoids)

- **R31 = 1 kΩ** (INA240→PA1): PA1 is TT_a, 3.6 V max; INA240 on 5 V can rail
  to 4.8 V in an OC transient; 100 Ω would inject 12 mA into the clamp (5 mA
  abs max). Do not "optimise" it back down.
- **I²C on I2C2/PA8+PA9**, never I2C1/PB8: PB8 is BOOT0 — a pull-up there
  boots the ROM loader. **OUT_REQ on PB14**, not PB4 (NJTRST reset pull-up
  would close the disconnect at boot).
- **TCAN1042 must be a VIO variant** (HGV or V-suffix): logic side is 3V3.
- **LM5145 SYNCIN doubles as DEM/FPWM select**; low = diode emulation =
  battery-safe default (R16 pulldown). PS_FPWM drives it.
- **Crystal must be CL = 8 pF** (C66/C67 = 10 pF), or change caps to 18 pF.
- **XAL1350-103: Isat ≈ 18 A @30 % (Coilcraft Doc373), DCR 8.7 mΩ** — an
  earlier claim of 28 A was wrong. ILIM peak is ~14 A; keep margin.
- **INA228 ALERT has no external pull-up** in schematic v1 — firmware enables
  PB7's internal one; add a discrete pull-up in the next schematic rev.
- **Grounding**: PGND/AGND split planes joined ONLY at NT1 (net-tie beside the
  sense amps); In1 has an AGND pocket under the LTC7004 cluster. Never add a
  via that shorts the domains — the seam geometry lives in gen_board.py
  (`SEAM`, `AUXW`, `POCKET`).
- **Kelvin shunt**: pours grab only the outer halves of R30's pads; sense
  traces leave the inner edges. Preserve this in any re-layout.
- Package truths (all datasheet-verified): LM5145 pin 15 = isolated "EP"
  perimeter pin + pad 21 die pad; DAC80502 DRX has NO exposed pad; LMR36015
  pin 3 = NC (datasheet ties to SW in copper only); LTC7004 = MSOP-10, EP=11;
  BAT54W is SC-70 pin1=A, 1N4148W pin1=K (opposite!).
- **Phase-2 (docs/08) load-bearing findings — do not "optimise" these away:**
  - **6.8 µH, not 4.7 µH**: LM5143 internal slope comp (~100 mV/µs @347 kHz)
    fails Ridley m_c(1−D) > 0.5 with 4.7 µH at D→0.93 (worst 0.44). 6.8 µH
    gives 0.61. Any change to L, R_S(3.5 mΩ) or f_sw reruns this check.
  - **INA240A3, not A4**: gain 200 on 0.5 mΩ puts 30 A at 3.0 V — above the
    DAC80502's 2.5 V full scale → CC loop capped at 25 A. A3 = 1.5 V @30 A.
  - **OVP squeeze**: divider ceiling 28.4 V < TLV7011 trip 29.4 V < bus 30 V.
    Only ~1 V each side — the OVP divider needs 0.1 % parts.
  - **Aux buck EN gated by LM5069 PGD**: load must stay off during inrush or
    it eats the P_LIM budget and can fault the start (TI rule). Don't tie
    LMR36015 EN high.

## Open items / known warts

- `autoroute.py`: 33 unconnected, router-via self-spacing bug, congested
  U3/U10 escapes — its header has the fix list. Deferred with the PCB work.
- DRC noise on the committed board: `lib_footprint_issues` (board-vs-library
  bookkeeping, harmless) and ~75 silk overlaps (cosmetic, clean up in the
  PCB batch).
- LCSC stock was thin on LTC7004 (5) and TLV7011 (42) at 2026-07-16.
- kicad-happy VM-001 flags CAN_RX/TX/STB as 5V↔3.3V crossings — false
  positives (VIO variant); I_MEAS was the one real hit (fixed via R31).
- `.remember/` memory files and `analysis/` run folders are working artifacts,
  not design data.

## Session/tooling quirks

- The permission classifier occasionally goes down mid-session ("temporarily
  unavailable"): wait and retry the same call; do read-only work meanwhile.
- KiCad 7.0.11: no CLI DRC/ERC — use `tools/run_drc.py`. Renders via
  `kicad-cli * export svg` + ImageMagick `convert` (rsvg-convert flaky).
- Coilcraft/Mouser/DigiKey product pages block scraping; use the jlcsearch
  API (no auth) for LCSC data, `curl` with browser UA for vendor PDFs, and
  the Farnell datasheet CDN as fallback.
